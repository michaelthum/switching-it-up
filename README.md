# Switching It Up

## Instructions

In the initial commit to this project, you have been provided with files that contain a JavaScript module and some associated tests. Currently the calculateScore function is causing the tests to fail. Your task is to rework this function so that it works as expected, making the tests pass.

## Provided Files

**scoring.js** - this file contains a JavaScript module called scoring with a `calculateScore` function. This function calls all of the other calculation functions to get a total score.

**tests.js** - this file contains tests for the `calculateScore` function in the `scoring` module

**package.json** - this file sets up the Node project including all the dev dependencies

**.babelrc** - this file allows mocha to read the code files written in ES6 syntax

**.gitignore** - this file sets the project up to ignore the node_modules folder when committing to git

## Exercise Submission

You should fork this repository and submit your working changes in a pull request to your forked repo.
